        Peyton Manning has always been a hero to me. Not ony is he one of the most decorated football players of all time and a top 5 quarterback in my books, he also has a unique way of carrying himself. Peyton has a certain way of establishing an equal sense of competitive nature along with a respect for everyone. No matter what he always brings a smile where he goes. Whether he is on the football field or not he changes lives. I hope to have an effect on the people in my life the way that Peyton does.
